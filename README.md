# hive-metamorphosis

Small scripts that transform different ways of representing games of Hive from one format to another.

Currently only a PGN -> [UHP string](https://github.com/jonthysell/Mzinga/wiki/UniversalHiveProtocol) converter is implemented

By running hive-metamorphosis "path to pgn file" the script will convert the pgn into a UHP string and save it in ./out.txt
